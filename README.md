# sssd-idmap-simulator
sssd idmap simulator is developed to help Linux administrators with proper configuration of algorithmic mapping from Active Directory SID to Unix UID/GID attributes. Simulator is helpful to check consequences of values configured for ldap_idmap_range_min, ldap_idmap_range_max and ldap_idmap_range_size in specific case, but a few runs with different values may explain more than hours of lecture.
